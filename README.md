# Python Week 5 - Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

This repository contains my solutions for **Week 5 OOP assignment**.  
It demonstrates the use of **classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism** in Python.

## Files
- **`smartphone.py`**  
  Implements a `Smartphone` class with features such as:
  - Powering on the device
  - Installing apps
  - Managing battery life

- **`polymorphism.py`**  
  Demonstrates polymorphism using different classes (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`) that share a common interface but have different implementations.
